default behavior:
	if the user attempts to play a gme file type:
		create a worker thread
		save the gme binary file to the worker thread
		start and save the emscripten instance to the worker thread
		render pcm data in the worker thread
		send pcm data to main thread for playback (or whatever)
		
		if the user attempts to play a different track from the same file:
			reuse the emscripten instance and binary file that are already in the worker thread
			render pcm data in the worker thread
			send pcm data to main thread for playback (or whatever)
